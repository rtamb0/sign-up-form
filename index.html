            <p>The Conduit has been recently discovered and we, Aoidos, are looking for people for hire to take part in an experiment involving the Conduit. The Conduit is capable of things such as space-time continuum, and as such, only a few qualified applicants will be selected in order to ensure the success of the experiment. In addition to the Conduit, an artificial intelligence called the Trinity Processor, is under development as a mean to govern the Conduit and the First Low Orbit Station from any unprecedented threats. This means that the applicant is also required to have at least a basic understanding of artificial intelligence.</p>
